title: Hi, I'm Michelle
---


<br>
I am a senior student from <a href="https://www.wm.edu/">College of William & Mary</a>, double majoring in computer science and application mathematics (statistics and probability concentration). I am a researcher in W&M <a href="https://www.wm.edu/offices/global-research/">Global Research Institute</a>, Geolab's AI-NLP team and Disinfolab. 
Academicaly, my recent research on A Novel Spatial Clustering method based on Triangulation-based DBSCAN has been published on 2023 JSM Proceeding. I did oral and poster presentation on <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2022/">Symposium on Data Science & Statistics</a> in May 2023. 


<br><br>
My current projects are about application of large language models, with the support from W&M AidData, IgniteLab, and Professor Mike Tierney's TRIP project. With a clear career goal in becoming a specialist in machine learning and data science, I gained certification from Azure Data Scientist Associate and AWS Cloud practitioner and harvested abundant working experience in the AI and machine learning area. More details can be found on my CV.

<br><br>
When I’m not doing ML, I like to play violin, enjoy music, and go traveling.
