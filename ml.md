**2023**

- **Triangulation and Desity Estimation based DBSCAN Clutering Algorithm**  
  - We proposed a spatial clustering algorithm for nonlinear data with various density and touching issue (including adjacent problem, neck problem, etc). 
  - Accepted by 2023 Symposium of Statistics and Data Science to present as a speaker and host poster session
  - Currently working on developing the algorithm into a python package

- **MCM: Analysis of Wordleâ€™s score distribution based on word attributes** 
  -  Create a word difficulty model by training word attributes data using Locally Weighted Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Decision Tree; use GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters
  -  Use the word difficulty model to predict the number of score reported in the future and how the percentage of players in hard mode changed based on different word attributes
