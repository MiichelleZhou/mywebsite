**2023**

- **AidData's 5-digit Coding Project**  
  - <a href="5digitcode.pdf"> Paper </a> coauthored by me and my collegue David Zhu on the Application of FLAN UL2 Model on OECD's Health Sector Data
  - We built the vector database in Pinecone to store all the embeddings (using SBERT) for health sector data from 1980 to 2020, implemented the whole framework for performing few-shot learning with dynamic retrieval of in-context examples
  - Improved the model accuracy from 88% to 97% by implementing dynamic retrieval of in-context examples; reducedannotation cost for sectors without training data by implementing fast vote-k selection of annotation

- **TRIP (Teaching, Research & International Policy)**
  - Accomplished prompt engineering on GPT4 API for the autocoding of professor Mike Tierney's TRIP project
  - Refer to the role-playing framework proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17760.pdf"> KAUST </a>

- **DisinfoLab**
  - Build a robust synthetic media detector as an AI platform to analyze and flag artificially and digitally generatedmedia
  - Fully trained two models with high accuracy on the VideoSham dataset; use Metaâ€™s Segment Anything to improve model performance
  - Integrate Weights & Biases MLOps into BA-TFD+ to track and manage training andtesting


**2022**

- **DeepLearning Certificate**
  - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
  - Natural Language Processing Specialization
